# noAds

- noAds is a project that identifies and blocks any advertisements while enjoying your favourite music on your favourite platforms.

# workflow

- When a request is made for a nameserver that contains an ad url from a known provider, the dns blocks the incoming ad response and kills the advertisement.

# policy

- The code is completely opensource and I recommend to selfhost it for privacy and anonimity purposes. But if that is too mcuh work for you, I have hosted this dns blocker on my domain

```bash
noads.realkeshav.tech
```

(p.s: I am hosting this in my room, please be gentle with the usage.)
