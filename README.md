# noAds

- noAds is a project that identifies and blocks any advertisements while enjoying your favourite music on your favourite platforms.

### workflow

- When a request is made for a nameserver that contains an ad url from a known provider, the proxy blocks the request and drops the request, hence killing the advertisement.

### policy

- The code is completely opensource and I recommend to selfhost on localhost for privacy and anonimity purposes. But if that is too much work for you, I have hosted this dns blocker on my vps and here is the connection info

```bash
someip:someport
```

(p.s: I am hosting this in my room, please be gentle with the usage.)
